# LinkedIn Search Link Builder

This is a static web app that lets you paste a list of names (optionally with companies) and instantly get LinkedIn search links.

## How to use
- Enter one person per line in the textarea.
- Click **Generate links** to see LinkedIn search results for each entry.
- Use **Copy shareable link** to generate a URL with your list embedded.

3. Select this repo, set:
   - Framework: **Other**

4. Deploy — you’ll get a live URL like `https://yourproject.vercel.app`.
