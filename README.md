# LinkedIn Search Link Builder

This is a static web app that lets you paste a list of names (optionally with companies) and instantly get LinkedIn search links.

## How to use
- Enter one person per line in the textarea.
- Links are generated automatically as you type.
- Use **Open all in tabs** to launch every search in a new tab.
- Use **Copy shareable link** to generate a URL with your list embedded.

## Deployment on Vercel
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In [Vercel](https://vercel.com), click **New Project** → Import Git Repository.
3. Select this repo, set:
   - Framework: **Other**
   - Build Command: *(leave blank)*
   - Output Directory: `.`
4. Deploy — you’ll get a live URL like `https://yourproject.vercel.app`.
