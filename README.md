# Quick LinkedIn Referral Finder for BNI Chapters

This is a static web app that lets you paste a list of names (optionally with companies) and instantly get LinkedIn, Facebook and Google search links.

## How to use
- Enter one person per line in the textarea.
- Links are generated automatically as you type.
- Use **Open all in LinkedIn**, **Open all in Facebook** or **Open all in Google** to launch every search in a new tab (appears when there are at least two names).
- Use **Copy shareable link** to generate a URL with your list embedded. Share it with the rest of the chapter to save time and increase referrals.

## Deployment on Vercel

3. Select this repo, set:
   - Framework: **Other**
